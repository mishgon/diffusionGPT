## reproducing GPT-2

A more serious deep learning professional may be more interested in reproducing GPT-2 results. So here we go - we first tokenize the dataset, in this case the [OpenWebText](https://openwebtext2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), an open reproduction of OpenAI's (private) WebText:

```sh
python data/openwebtext/prepare.py
```

This downloads and tokenizes the [OpenWebText](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openwebtext) dataset. It will create a `train.bin` and `val.bin` which holds the GPT2 BPE token ids in one sequence, stored as raw uint16 bytes. Then we're ready to kick off training. To reproduce GPT-2 (124M) you'll want at least an 8X A100 40GB node and run:

```sh
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 train.py config/train_gpt2.py
```

This will run for about 4 days using PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) and go down to loss of ~2.85. Now, a GPT-2 model just evaluated on OWT gets a val loss of about 3.11, but if you finetune it it will come down to ~2.85 territory (due to an apparent domain gap), making the two models ~match.

If you're in a cluster environment and you are blessed with multiple GPU nodes you can make GPU go brrrr e.g. across 2 nodes like:

```sh
# Run on the first (master) node with example IP 123.456.123.456:
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --nnodes=2 --node_rank=0 --master_addr=123.456.123.456 --master_port=1234 train.py
# Run on the worker node:
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --nnodes=2 --node_rank=1 --master_addr=123.456.123.456 --master_port=1234 train.py
```

It is a good idea to benchmark your interconnect (e.g. iperf3). In particular, if you don't have Infiniband then also prepend `NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1` to the above launches. Your multinode training will work, but most likely _crawl_. By default checkpoints are periodically written to the `--out_dir`. We can sample from the model by simply `python sample.py`.

Finally, to train on a single GPU simply run the `python train.py` script. Have a look at all of its args, the script tries to be very readable, hackable and transparent. You'll most likely want to tune a number of those variables depending on your needs.

## baselines

OpenAI GPT-2 checkpoints allow us to get some baselines in place for openwebtext. We can get the numbers as follows:

```sh
$ python train.py config/eval_gpt2.py
$ python train.py config/eval_gpt2_medium.py
$ python train.py config/eval_gpt2_large.py
$ python train.py config/eval_gpt2_xl.py
```

and observe the following losses on train and val:

| model | params | train loss | val loss |
| ------| ------ | ---------- | -------- |
| gpt2 | 124M         | 3.11  | 3.12     |
| gpt2-medium | 350M  | 2.85  | 2.84     |
| gpt2-large | 774M   | 2.66  | 2.67     |
| gpt2-xl | 1558M     | 2.56  | 2.54     |

However, we have to note that GPT-2 was trained on (closed, never released) WebText, while OpenWebText is just a best-effort open reproduction of this dataset. This means there is a dataset domain gap. Indeed, taking the GPT-2 (124M) checkpoint and finetuning on OWT directly for a while reaches loss down to ~2.85. This then becomes the more appropriate baseline w.r.t. reproduction.

## sampling / inference

Use the script `sample.py` to sample either from pre-trained GPT-2 models released by OpenAI, or from a model you trained yourself. For example, here is a way to sample from the largest available `gpt2-xl` model:

```sh
python sample.py \
    --init_from=gpt2-xl \
    --start="What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?" \
    --num_samples=5 --max_new_tokens=100
```

If you'd like to sample from a model you trained, use the `--out_dir` to point the code appropriately. You can also prompt the model with some text from a file, e.g. ```python sample.py --start=FILE:prompt.txt```.

## todos

- Reproduce GPT-2 as a baseline
- Implement diffusion GPT model training
- Log how PPL upper bound depends on the number of diffusion timesteps
- Investigate and add FSDP instead of DDP
